# CHALLENGE 1 - WEEK 1  

Alchemy-University-Road-To-Web3

Take a look at any dictionary and you’ll get some version of the definition below for the word ‘Alchemy’ -- A word I’ve always not only liked the sound of, but the meaning as well:

> *‘Alchemy’: any magical power or process of transmuting a common substance, usually of little value, into a substance of great value.*

It’s magical. You’re trying to turn one thing from some earlier state into another. Whether that is water into wine or sand into gold from the times of old or the more recent times of every day. Think chemists for a more literal sense, but what about artists using Artificial Intelligence? An artist takes either a common ‘word’, ‘a ‘prompt’ and turns this into a piece of sought after, highly coveted art. Is this magic? ‘Alchemy”?

What about the state of the blockchain? If we are talking about this definition in particular let’s take the words ‘a common substance of little value’ so maybe any digital item that is created and run through the Ethereum Blockchain and out of nowhere…this  is turned into a collection of sold out ERC721 tokens. These ERC721 tokens are now on every buyer’s  watch list and every creatoor is trying to achieve this accomplishment not all of them will. This is an example of our modern day alchemy along with coding in any language. Let’s type in a a few characters and poof this commonplace item creates an expensive, transactional marketplace. There are many examples and the name alchemy is a perfect fit for this developers platform that has a school for anyone that wants to learn modern day ‘magic’.

WEEK 1 - CHALLENGE 1
How to Develop an NFT Smart Contract (ERC721) with Alchemy

# Answers to Questions are also on GitHub: 

Who are you, and what is your software development background?

I’m an artist, always have been. My dev background is pretty much me teaching myself any and everything I can about smart contracts so I can understand what I am putting my name to. It’s come to the point that I would like to be able to ‘create' for others, but also advocate for myself when things go wrong as they always do. I’d like to be my own tech support and understand the space I’m in. I want to build. 

2. Why did you want to complete this lesson?

Well, I want to complete each and every lesson I can. I want to absorb as much knowledge as I can especially if it helps protect me in the nft art space

3. When did you complete the project?

11.11.22 was when I completed this part of the project, but I completed part I of the challenge yesterday 11.10.22. I’m new to finding the program and plan to 

4. What technologies did you use?

Alchemy, OpenZeppelin, REMIX, MetaMask, OpenSea, Goerli, , Mirror, FileBase, IPFS, Github, Terminal, Notion (notes), npm, node.js, Discord

5. What did you enjoy about the tutorial? 

Following along was pretty easy bc I've been reading and dealing w smart contracts for a few months. I enjoy anything that has to do with NFTs and contracts so using Remix is really interesting. I'd like to get to the point where I can just put them together and create anything. I did add the burn function to mine so I can go back and learn a little about that as well. Hope that's ok!

6. How do you think you can use this technology to build useful applications in the future? What are some specific example applications?

In so many ways. In creating NFTs for my art in the future, but in creating the apps that the contracts & NFTs run on. Apps like DUNE for analytics and ledgers and most importantly as mentioned above -- I’d like to be my own tech support in every way possible. 

7.Who would you recommend this project to?

Anyone that wants to be ready for whats coming down the pipeline.

8. What is the Ethereum wallet address you would like to receive your PoK at?
