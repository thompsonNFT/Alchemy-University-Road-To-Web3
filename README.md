# CHALLENGE 1 - WEEK 1  

Alchemy-Road to Web3 

Take a look at any dictionary and you’ll get some version of the definition below for the word ‘Alchemy’ -- A word I’ve always not only liked the sound of, but the meaning as well:

> *‘Alchemy’: any magical power or process of transmuting a common substance, usually of little value, into a substance of great value.*

It’s magical. You’re trying to turn one thing from an earlier state into another ... from nothing into something. Whether that is water into wine or sand into gold -- from the times of old or jump to present day. Think chemists for a more literal sense, but what about artists using Artificial Intelligence? An artist takes either a common ‘word’, ‘a ‘prompt’ and turns this into a piece of sought after, highly coveted art. What about the generative art category - when artists take a tiny piece of code, every day symbols and letters and turn those mathematical algorithms into a piece that is something like Tyler Hobbs' Fidenzas? Is this magic? Could this be today's ‘Alchemy”?

When pertaining to the state of the blockchain, coding, applications, mathematical languages, ai art, algorithms -- there will be these instances of an everyday, commonplace item transforming into something that is catapulted past its competetoors. The name alchemy is a perfect fit for this developer's platform -- it's a perfect fit for anyone that wants to learn modern day ‘magic’.

It's nice to meet you, I'm an artist...mostly abstract, I've included some links to my art, but I'm trying to teach myself how to be my own tech support in the world that is and is going to be smart contracts & NFTS. I am creating my own smart contracts in Manifold. I’d very much like to get a better understand of said contracts. I’d like to be able to be my own tech support and add my own extensions to my own contracts — the goal is a better understanding of the code and the language in order to understand what I am signing my name to.

# WEEK 1 - CHALLENGE 1
How to Develop an NFT Smart Contract (ERC721) with Alchemy

# Answers to Questions : 

Who are you, and what is your software development background?

I’m an artist, always have been. My dev background is pretty much me teaching myself any and everything I can about smart contracts so I can understand what I am putting my name to. It’s come to the point that I would like to be able to ‘create' for others, but also advocate for myself when things go wrong as they always do. I’d like to be my own tech support and understand the space I’m in. I want to build. (I guess my software dev background is not terribly extensive! haha)

2. Why did you want to complete this lesson?

Well, I want to complete each and every lesson I can. I want to absorb as much knowledge as I can especially if it helps protect me in the nft art space

3. When did you complete the project?

11.11.22 3:30am

4. What technologies did you use?

Alchemy, OpenZeppelin, REMIX, MetaMask, OpenSea, Goerli, , Mirror, FileBase, IPFS, Github, Terminal, Notion (notes), npm, node.js, Discord

5. What did you enjoy about the tutorial? 

Following along was pretty easy bc I've been reading and dealing w smart contracts for a few months. I enjoy anything that has to do with NFTs and contracts so using Remix is really interesting. I'd like to get to the point where I can just put them together and create anything. I did add the burn function to mine so I can go back and learn a little about that as well. Hope that's ok!

6. How do you think you can use this technology to build useful applications in the future? What are some specific example applications? 

There are so many use cases for this tech. Just to expand on adding the specific functions to existing smart contracts…know how to do this is key in todays society. I think there are so few people that actually ‘understand’ what they are doing. In creating NFTs for my art in the future, but in creating the apps that the contracts & NFTs run on. Apps like DUNE for analytics and ledgers and most importantly as mentioned above. I’d like to be my own tech support in every way possible. There will be many applications like analytic apps, tracking & counting apps, information processing & managing future projects. The applications are key to keeping future projects running smoothly - Alchemy makes so much of this possibly & I’d love to be able to create these apps. 

7.Who would you recommend this project to?

8. What did you learn from the project? 

I learned a bit more on how to tailor a contract to one’s specific functions. (I added the burn function to my contract so I can learn from it. 

Anyone that wants to be ready for whats coming down the pipeline. 1 friend has already signed up

9. What is the Ethereum wallet address you would like to receive your PoK at?
